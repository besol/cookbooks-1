Given the nature of this installation process (and it's variance across multiple operating systems), we will leave this installation process to the user.\n\nYou must also have `bundler` installed:\n\n    $ gem install bundler\n\nYou must also have Vagrant and VirtualBox installed:\n\n- [Vagrant](https://vagrantup.com)\n- [VirtualBox](https://virtualbox.org)\n\nOnce installed, you must install the `vagrant-berkshelf` plugin:\n\n    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf\n\n\nDevelopment\n-----------\n1. Clone the git repository from GitHub:\n\n        $ git clone git@github.com:opscode-cookbooks/COOKBOOK.git\n\n2. Install the dependencies using bundler:\n\n        $ bundle install\n\n3. Create a branch for your changes:\n\n        $ git checkout -b my_bug_fix\n\n4. Make any changes\n5. Write tests to support those changes. It is highly recommended you write both unit and integration tests.\n6. Run the tests:\n    - `bundle exec rspec`\n    - `bundle exec foodcritic .`\n    - `bundle exec rubocop`\n    - `bundle exec kitchen test`\n\n7.
